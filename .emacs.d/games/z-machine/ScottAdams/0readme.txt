                             Playing Hints
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Draw a map as you go, there are a lot more places than you think and
without a map you will end up going round in circles or missing areas
which you haven't tried. It doesn't need to be perfect as long as you
have some record of where you have been and what you've found (as well
as where you found it). Examine things you find and try to remember
that most problems have solutions that require no more than some
careful thought and a little common sense. If you get stuck try typing
HELP -- you may or may not get assistance but you won't know until you
ask. And be careful about assuming things, it can be fatal.

To speed things up you may use the following abbreviations N, S, E, W,
U, D, for Go North, South, East, West, Up or Down. I is short for
Inventory and will list what you're carrying.

Some (but not all) of the words available that you may find useful
are: --

Get, Take, Drop, Go, Climb, Jump, Enter, Examine, Go, Leave, Move,
Quit, Say, Wear, Read, Save, Light, Pull, Push and Look ... There are
others!!!

Instructions are entered by you in the form of two word commands with
the first word being a verb. If the computer doesn't understand, it
will tell you so and you must try rewording what you wish to do (e.g.
instead of GO FLYING try FLY). You will find that objects which can be
picked up usually require only the last part of their name as in the
Blue Ox where typing GET OX is all that is needed.

Good luck, happy adventuring and try not to die too often.
